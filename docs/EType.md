# TYPE ENUM

### OVERVIEW

The Distribution enum holds five elements

1- ```Scalar``` : 1 by 1 Matrix

2- ```Vector``` : n by 1 matrix

3- ```VectorTransposed``` 1 by n matrix

4- ```Matrix``` n by m matrix

5- ```SquareMatrix``` n by n matrix
		
This enum is used when calling the Type function in the [matrix class](https://github.com/void-intelligence/Nomad/blob/master/docs/Matrix.md).

The value of this enum is always calculated based on the shape of the matrix, and within the [shape class](https://github.com/void-intelligence/Nomad/blob/master/docs/Shape.md).
